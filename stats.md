## Correlation

- Binary vs continuous: point-biserial correlation. It is mathematically equivalent to pearson's correlation.

## Standard Error:
- Bootstrapping method to calculate SE and CI: sampling with replacement for thousands of times (like repeating experiment thousands of times), 
	- SE: calculate SD of the statistic 
	- 95% CI: 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the thousands of sample statistic.
